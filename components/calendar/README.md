# Calendar

The calendar of Bayu Desktop. It shows events by day, week, month and
year, with repeating events, alerts and several coloured calendars, and reads
and writes standard iCalendar files. Calendars published on the web, such as
public holidays, can be subscribed to and are kept up to date.

Events are kept as one `.ics` file per event in
`~/.local/share/bayu-calendar/calendars/`, one directory per calendar.
`bayu-calendar-reminders` starts with the session and shows alerts as
notifications while the calendar is closed.

## Dependencies

Calendar uses the Bayu toolkit (`bayu-toolkit`), libical, ICU and
libcurl (for subscribed web calendars).
