// Skia's GPU backend on a GLES context the host owns and keeps current, for
// EmbeddedWindow::render() into the host's textures: no context of the
// toolkit's own and no sharing. Windows and this object free GL objects when
// destroyed, so destroy them with the context current, or after abandon().
//
// The GL state contract, per render into a texture:
// - Before drawing, Skia forgets all the GL state it cached
//   (GrDirectContext::resetContext), as the host changed it since.
// - After drawing, the framebuffer bindings, the viewport, the scissor box
//   and test, the clear colour and dithering are what they were before.
// - Everything else is left as follows, which the host may rely on:
//   program 0; vertex array 0 with every attribute disabled, divisor 0 and
//   pointer (4, FLOAT, unnormalised, stride 0, no buffer, offset 0); array,
//   element, pixel pack and unpack buffers 0; texture unit 0 active, 2D and
//   external textures and samplers unbound on every unit up to 16; blending
//   off with (ONE, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) and ADD; colour mask all; depth,
//   stencil, cull face, polygon offset, alpha-to-coverage and primitive
//   restart off; pixel store alignments 4 and row lengths 0.
// - Drawing is submitted (glFlush) but not waited for; the host's later
//   commands on the same context see the texture finished.
